 I wish the carrying case was a little bigger to hold the head phones that came with the player and if it came with a charger. Overall seems easy to use and the kids can figure it out too.
"Nice system, good features. Still learning my way around the system but so far impressed."
I bought this product at Best Buy for over $30 and then found it here at Walmart.com for half the price! 
They did sound good but they don't last no time. I only had them for two weeks and both sides don't work anymore. DO NOT buy these. I should have listened to the other reviews about how they don't last. #AnotherLessonLearned

I m satisfied with the Best sound from BOSE but this one is my favorite
"I just switched to Samsung. This is the most amazing phone, with a gorgeous design, and very reasonable price for the advanced features that are being offered."
Charged for 12 hours. Hard to sync the remote to the actual drone. Would take off once and after that won't take off.
"I'm very happy with the picture quality. Live view is quick to respond. Night view is very clear. The microphone is sensitive and clear. Two-way communication works, but it can be hard to understand someone talking through the camera's speaker. It takes a Micro SD card which isn't included. The software is easy to work with for the most part and initial setup was a breeze. Some minor annoyances keep me from rating this as a full 5 stars. I can't seem to get any audio on motion event recordings. I've checked the settings and it just doesn't seem to work. Live view audio is fine. I'm also a bit confused on how to adjust the motion recording sensitivity. There's a motion sensitivity option under ""Alarm Notification"" which would seem to indicate that this only adjusts the sensitivity for push alerts. In reality, I don't know if that's the case or not. I think there should be a separate section for motion recording sensitivity. There's also no option that I can see for sound based triggers. I'm not knocking any points on this one, but it'd be nice Overall I find this to be an excellent value. It is easy to set up, easy to start a live view, and easy to view recordings at the preset sensitivity, but I would caution potential buyers that have any needs beyond that to ensure that this truly fits the bill.

It's an okay tv not to thrilled about it but I'm using it for my guest room.
It's horrible! Doesn't charge. Only turns on us plugged in....doesnt help when you need it for the car
I really like this little TV it's perfect right now where I'm at ....got a $20 antenna and picture is crystal clear and an awesome price ....the only thing that was disappointing was the speaker..that's the only reason for 4 stars out of 5 ....I WAS expecting that from the reviews on here before I bought so I bought today these speakers and it made a HUGE difference...I can still use the external speakers for other things so it's not like I lost money ... I would buy this TV again but for the price you can't beat it ....just HORRIBLE sound so be prepared....if you have computer speakers then plug it in and your all set https://www.walmart.com/ip/Blackweb-Multimedia-Computer-Speaker/43920722

"This is our second Vizio purchase and we are completely satisfied with the product. The other TV worked great and was replaced due to the contract expiration for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime."
I bought this a few weeks ago and I'm happy with the purchase. I was deciding between this and the beatspill+ but decided to get this because of the color choices and the power bank option. I also like how it's waterproof.
"Great little indoor camera. Its petite size makes it easy to place, without it standing out too much. Finding a place for it was made easier by the longer than normal USB cable that it comes with. Came with a wall mount bracket , but I didn't mount mine. I like that I have the option to mount if needed though. Downloading and setting up the app was a breeze. Has a crystal clear image while viewing the feed. Everything is perfect. It has been a great addition to my home security. I have been using this for a few weeks now and haven't had a single issue with the video or the app. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Today is September 8, 2016. Purchased the camera October, 2015. Could never get it to work. Company replaced it, to this day, never worked. Claimed something was defective. It's been sitting for most of the year. Today I opted to throw it out. After a while their customer service people get tired of talking to you and don't take your calls. Piece of junk."
"My daughter is in Love with Frozen, bought these headphones especially to go with her Kindle fire they do a wonderful job keeping the noise down and she loves how they don't hurt her ears or head when she wears them for long periods of time."
Horrible sound -- like an old am transistor radio. It's going back for a better model.
Great product. Best price. Thank you
"Bought this to replace a similar unit that gave up the ghost. It plays our VHS tapes and the 3 DVD formats we have (+R, +RW, -R). That's all we needed it to do."
I Recently ordered four pairs of Dickies short sleeve coveralls and am very pleased with this product. They are lightweight and comfortable yet durable enough for farm labor. My husband had two old pairs that he had worn for years and loved them so I had no concerns about purchasing Dickies again.
We have been using this for a month and a half. I love that I have choices of what I want to watch not just what is scheduled
Probably the most amazing thing about this product is the incredible Bluetooth capabilities and sound. I could listen to my music in my ears with my phone charging 4 rooms away with the music still sounding crisp and outstanding! Honestly worth the price!
I purchased this television during the holidays and so glad that I did!
The watch would never sync to my phone. I have a LG.
So far I was using apple phone...Now after using s9 plus I can easily recommend this to friends.
Great pictures and great designs Good price. Great sound [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Arrived on time. Great product and meets all expectations. A little confusing to hook up to all my other electronic components, but otherwise I'm very pleased with this product!"
The cord to plug into the DVD player doesn't plug in all the way it doesn't have a full charge and when I went to try to get my money back they wanted to charge me an additional $35 to replace the item even though it was a Christmas gift so since it was past the due date
can't connect it to my network 5ghz....and i dont know why it can t see the same network that is also 2.4 ghz 3 stars now waiting for and answer....
Received them today. Completely garbled noise from speakers and mic. Really didn't expect such low quality. Will return!
It's amazing must buy for get all those Bluetooth speakers like the xb90 jbl boombox the monster xl this thing compares for less money buyyy it now it's amazing I thought it wanna gonna be a cheap crappy sounding speaker but no it's amazing
"I bought the Roku to replace my apple device because the apple did not have Amazon or Acorn. The Roku does offer more channels, but the remote is awful. The apple remote was easy to use with only one button. The Roku is so confusing; it has way too many buttons. Plus the device is huge!"
This TV is amazing. We mounted it and it looks and works amazing.
Not reset back to Factory setting
Child loved it
"What a great little network camera! The ease of installation is awesome. If you know your way around a tablet or smartphone setup is a breeze. The picture quality is amazing! What more could you ask for??? 1080 resolution for a great result. Very easy to use with Alexa echo show, and Wink. I bought this camera to test the ability to integrate with my other smart home devices. I love it, and the ability to watch the puppy just adds to the value. I have 8 other cameras that may end up getting replaced with the nest cameras."
a friend had it and loved it
Nice works buttons are a little ch e a p but the price was worth it.
Best speaker i ever owned.I love my UEMEGABOOM!
I was extremely disappointed after receiving order promptly that it required a cable box to work. That information is NOT written on any instructions. Had I known this it could have been avoided. My other set works great just installed in cable wall outlet. An oversight in marketing product since reading the reviews another customer had the same issue. I unplugged tv from both-repacked and return to Walmart. They kindly refunded money.
I definitely recommend this product! Very high quality for this price. Excellent for the gym!
"It fits perfectly, and the keys are surprisingly quiet. Synced up perfectly with my iPad in about 3 seconds, and I haven't had to recharge it yet. I haven't a single complaint so far...(I only say ‚Äúso far‚Äù because it's been about a week since it arrived)"
"I've used the Roku external unit for years, and have always found it easy to use and accurate. I bought a new HDTV recently, and was concerned that the Roku unit, built into the TV, wouldn't be as good. It's better! Very easy to use, and delivers the material you want to see effortlessly. I'm a big fan of it, especially after using the units of friends that are always difficult."
"User friendly, easy to use the app and set up through Amazon Alexa. It makes me feel secure that I can turn my lights off and on whenever I need it."
"Worked good, loud, battery life about 2-3 hours. Six months in and out doesn't charge up anymore. Disappointed."
"I originally was not going to go with this model, but was surprisingly impressed with the difference between the 8000 series and the Q60. It was a very refreshing surprise and I'm glad I made the decision to go up a model! All the smart features and recognition with devices and available apps are a nice selection! The picture of the Q60 Is a nice upgrade from my old Samsung TV with 120 Hz vibrant picture. Would highly recommend upgrading to the Qled series from Samsung!

The TV is great. Holy wish it had a better interface when it came to Google TV [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My boyfriend bought this for me yesterday and I love it clean clear crisp sound and does not bog down when u have a song on with a lot of bass
"It\'s a terrible phone, I ordered it as it said it was unlocked it didn?t work with my carrier and when I got it, the phone had red coming off and around the camera was all scratched up. I couldn?t even get a refund. Will never order again"
"I have only had the headphones for about a few hours and they work great. I walked around my entire house and they didn't fade or go out. Sound great, I am satisfied with my purchase so for. Shipped to my house is two days. I will buy again. Bass sound good!!!"
Great deal love RCA products.
"my son enjoys to listen to audio books, this is a pretty good headset."
"Picked up item from store, the shipping box was baddly damage, the apple box had very little defects and scratches. I opened the box and tried to connect to phone and watch kept factory resetting and acted like was refurbished and wanted to connect to old set up. Randomly during set up went to Black screen with apple and occasionally switches to black screen. No tips or tricks will change the screen. I will be exchanging for a product that works."
I put the two I bought in the trash. I got tiered of trying to reconnect each time the power or internet went out.
"I purchased it a month ago and I absolutely love it!!! The GPS is amazing. I just ran my first 1/2 marathon, and I am sooooo glad that I was able to just my Garmin- Forerunner 35 for the race."
Great Product for the money [...]
Have had this watch for a week now and haven't taken it off. So many features and new ones added all the time on the connect app. Easy to use and so light you barely even notice it's on. WINNER
i dont have it yet but about to buy it as we can like after time is finish and i hope it will be great as always wallmart every time do great things
"The sims card did not fit, had to send back for refund. The phone came before scheduled so that was awesome."
I bought to sets of these earbuds for Christmas gifts. One for my husband and one for my son. Only one set actually works. The set the works is okay. Doesn't produce great sound but is adequate. I would not waste my money on these as you just don't know what you are going to get. I can't even get a refund because I purchased these in early November and there is only a 30 day guarantee on them and that expired before I was able to give them as gifts.
The headphones are comfortable on your ears. I took a 9 hour flight and had them in most of the time and never got a headache or earache. I slept with them on too! The only thing I don't like is there is no light to tell you they are on. But the battery lasts a very long time as long as the noise cancelling button is off. It even seems to let at least 10 hours with the button on.
"This is super slow and in less then 6 months it will not even turn on. So slow in fact my 3 yr old will not even use it, when it actually kind of worked."
"The phone works excellent! It came in 100% perfect condion, but the charger doesnt work. Thats just one problem."
Have tried everything with the wand/remote which does its own thing! Very frustrating! We like our old Roku 2 much better!
"My 55"" LG finally gave out after many years. Being totally satisfied with LG, and after comparing picture quality in a local store of LG and others, LG still wins hands down!! The sharpest, richest picture in my opinion."
Don't bother buying this tv. It is a waste of time. I tried one that kept muting itself at odd times when nothing was initiating it. I returned it and exchanged it for another one. Couldn't even get that one to turn on. I returned that one too. I am not trying again for a 3rd time.
I have had 2 in the last 6 months and both stopped charging and it takes to long to do download.. Didn't load most days.. I will buy a different name brand next time.. Never this brand
All I can say is thank you! This is my 5th ROKU and this on exceeds all.
A single hub works great. But you cannot have more than one on a single account. I have lights at two locations that I want to control remotely. I can only control one location remotely. This seems like a simple thing to do. Phillips needs to correct this.
"Yes, it work on Verizon service, and very good. You just have to do right choice in network settings."
I just got my Vivo3 today. Not really blown away with it. It does not register any flights of stairs. Done much research online and it seems to be an ongoing problem with no solution. I am not getting any notifications either. I'm sorry that I paid a bundle for a unit that does not work as well as my old pocket tracker. So disappointed.
I love the Roku. I have the Fire Stick and Chromecast but Roku works the best. The apps are better and they work better on the Roku.
"For inexpensive top-of-the-line smartphone, this product is infested with bugs. A significant percentage of the time the entire touch screen function does not work. I have to go push the start button and log back in. This can happens in any kind of text input situation. The same malfunction happens at the three buttons at the bottom of the screen which on prior phones were hardware whereas here they are part of the software screen. Very annoying. The highly-vaunted feature-laden camera quite often locks up on me. You activate auto exposure/ autofocus function and it just sits there and refuses to take a picture no matter how many times you push the shutter button. To cure this I have to actually go and restart the entire phone. Here's another negative feature. The camera doesn't tell you what kind of resolution you are using when you change picture size. You have to go to Google to find that out The native Samsung voice-to-text function is really inferior to Google. And to add Google voice to your keyboard requires drilling down through a number of screens. It took me about 15 or 20 minutes to actually find this and do this. The so called adaptive brightness for the display screen doesn't work at all. I'm always having to go into settings and adjusting the brightness up or down."
"These are decent-ish for the price you pay. I've had them two weeks and I have noticed soooo many issues with pairing and connecting these to my devices, as well as them randomly shutting off after 10 minutes of use."
"Ordered two tablets. One had a screen defect the other would randomly not boot. Otherwise looked to be a good value, just need a little quality control. No problems getting those two problems resolved with Lenovo. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this everyday for recording tv shows and replay next day. I only have regular tv and I can watch tv shows when I want. I would recommend it .
The speaker never played clearly always statically turning off randomly
I brought this las month and am not satisfied with it !!
I have a week with the phone this phones is super nice. 1. Design: very cool and feel very comfortable in the hands and is very attractive 2. Battery life: the battery is good but if you will play and watch movie make sure you have a bank with you if you are doing outside. 3. Edge: Personally is unusable for me but that give a special look to the phone. 4. Cameras: I just can say is pure quality in photography mode video is ok. Things I don't like. Battery life: is not too long how I spect. After watching a movies 1:30 hrs I need to recharger the device. I have a cheaper phone with same life time Edge: not have function that you really need or add things that could be functional. Rear side: please remove the Cristal and give me metal that add extra life to the device.
I got this watch for Father's day. Now 2 months later I'm dealing with a warranty claim because the back fell off. Like others I haven't abused it. The problems started a few weeks ago when I noticed the watch wasn't charging properly. Figured that I could get it to take a charge if I set something on top of the watch when it was on the charger. 2 weeks later and I pull my watch off the charger and the back doesn't come with it. Super disappointed especially since this seems like a real issue that others are having. The watch itself was great when it worked and I always got compliments on it. It was much better than the Ticwatch E that I started out with but somehow that watch is still holding together while this more expensive watch cannot. Hopefully my replacement holds together better...
Bought this a couple weeks ago and couldn't be happier!
"I was hesitant to purchase this TV, I was evaluating between a Sony, LG and this particular model, after a close comparison the Samsung 7100 series has more value and features than their close rivals. I have a few Samsung equipment and I will be loyal to the brand. Thank you Samsung for reliable products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great phone for the price.I dont do the contract so for a pre paid phone i think it is awesome does everything i need it to do.
"This speaker is so awesome, I use it quite often and it performs the same as it did when I first had the speaker. Truly great quality and the battery-life is so long."
Smart tv features easy to use. Great picture. Cord organization. Sound better than most [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
average tv...good priceand hopefully doesnt break
I love it nice TV Vizio simply easy a apps and enjoy sounds music
When i got the phone it worked for the first couple if hours than the screen stopped responding to my touch . I thought maybe i could take it and get it fixed for a low price but told me it was beyond repair when they tried repairing it . So the phone doesnt work
They work really well.
"I had to purchase 3 tablets to get one that worked right. The tablet works fine until the battery gets low. Once it died, I couldn't charge it anymore. They said it was a bad port where the charger connected. I say 3 times!!!!!?"
"These blow all other headphones out of the water. I have tried all brands to ultimately come back to these as my travel, gym, and walking headphones. Once the music is playing you cant hear the person next to you. Can be used as ear muff in the Chicago winter."
Love the headphone sound great but the earpiece is too small
great system works awesome day or night easy to install and setup. would recommend to anyone
Easy to set up and good range. I placed the sensor on the door downstairs and the receiver in the hallway upstairs. I can hear the receiver even downstairs but it is not too loud to be annoying even when I am near it. I would have given 5 stars if I could actually use it on the front door as intended. The sensor is a bit wide (which is great as you have more area to stick to) but if you have door jambs with moulding then the two pieces cannot fit flush and will not work. Before you buy this make sure your door is flush with the frame or the pieces will have to be set too far apart initially to make the connection and it will not work. I managed to place mine on the sliding glass door at the back but would need to raise the sensor about half an inch to work on the front door. I hope that makes sense.
"When I got it in my hand, I was a little shock by its side. but the speaker sound clear, and it is pretty louder. Hope the battery last enough."
Phone will not hold a charge. Goes dead after minutes of use
"This is NOT the ""latest Model"" of airpod but that's ok. I didn't actually want the ""latest model"". Based on the picture and the very lightweight information provided, I guessed that in fact, this was the previous model and it is. It's rechargeable airpods with a wireless rechargeable base."
This TV is a great piece to have in the house for the bedroom. It does not overcrowd the room and you have all the technology of one of the giant TV's.
"This ear buds are great, they fit great and are super comfortable. I have really small ears so I have a really hard time finding ear buds that will actually fit and stay in my ears but these ones stay no problem!"
Tv's WiFi constantly disconnects and the picture is terrible. Returning this...
Great product my son is two and he is able to see so many educational channels
I am so glad that I found this item when I did. I absolutely love it. I can't believe it was the price got it for.
i bought for my husband he loves it i have bought from amazing forless severl times all different iteams they are all amazing
"Received my Venu watch about two weeks ago and I love it! Very easy to use right out of the box. AMOLED display is eye catching. I've received so many compliments at work. Functional, comfortable and stylish everything you need in a watch. The oximeter is a little off but that is no deal breaker for me. I charge the battery about every 3-4 days."
I got this as a Christmas gift and it works well. Can't wait to use it more.
"This phone look like used and the charger they send is not the I phone charger and its a smart phone cheap charger / head phone not included, box was not sealed"
Awesome!!! Got a deal in it for around $240....totally worth the price!!!
"Very easy to set up. Lots of fun and also convenient when having a disgreement about something. Google Home will solve it by just asking the question about the disagreement and she has the answer. As for Walmart, received the product extremely fast and exactly what was ordered."
My daughter loves it
"I bought one about 9 months ago and havent used it all but the first month. After using it for a few weeks it lost all battery life so i had to have it plugged in (so much for wireless). Next it wouldnt connect my computer via bluetooth at all, but it did the first couple of weeks. Now i was fine with this because i could still plug it in but that really annoyed me, because i was inbetween regular computer speakers but decided to go with the slick looking wireless one that was $100 dollars more. Now it is totally done, it wont even play sound. It will play for 3 seconds then cuts out then back in making it virtually useless. This was a waste of money and the best part is that best buy wont let me return since its been longer than a month."
Great quality
We just upgraded to the Roku streaming stick + and have been thrilled with the picture quality. Very easy to set up also. Our whole family loves Roku!
Love the device but seems like maybe a problem with bluetooth firmware; not showing up as a pairing option on my phone or computer.
The mattress didnt expand to the 6inches it said it would but is still very comfortable and works for a kids bunkbed.
Been using it forever. What else do you need to know.
"The Fitbit was okay excpet it stopped syncing in less than a year. The features are great, but it is a device not made to last. I received this Fitbit as a replacement for a Fitbit Charge that broke in less than a year also. It would behoove you to get an extended warranty on these devices if you have to have one."
Picture is very clear and crisp and the sound is really good also.
So I'm never the type of person to leave a review on a product the I am overly impressed with the sound quality and bass of these headphones I use to be a skull candy addict for it that crazy bass these headphones blow them out of the water only company I'm ever going to use when I need a new pair of headphones currently using them for music production as well as gaming good microphone and they don't hurt your ears when they've been in for a very long time thank you so much for making an amazing product LONG LIVE JLAB!
"The iPhone is great, but they sent me a phone that was locked into Sprint and not AT&T. But I had to make around 12 calls to find out what was wrong."
I have had this tv for 3 years with ZERO problems. I dont use the wifi i use the wired internet and have no lag or problems. sound wise I use a sound bar but the tv speakers werent all that bad. picture quality and screen have been great. I googled best picture settings for this tv and dialed it in and it looks just as good as any other tv i have seen in friends or families house. maybe i got lucky but i have 4 tcl tv's in my house with no problems....Im sure sony and LG etc all have thier fair share of disgruntled customers who happened to get a bad tv. all the parts are coming from the same places its just the brand thats slapped on the box at the end.
"I bought a pair of these yesterday at the store. First thoughts on the product were pretty good. My friend has a pair and recommended them so I rode my bike and got them and it sounded great on the ride home. Later on in the I turned them on, I was about to turn on my music and I heard a noise. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if it is a white noise or what but there is a sound every time I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m about to play a sound. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if it happens on every product or what. I hear it sometimes during my music being played. Other wise it is a good product and I would recommend it."
Easy to assemble and disassemble. Great to travel with and easy to store
"The picture posted below is the phone you will be rececing and should be in the description. No complaints on the phone thus far and if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re an apple prosuct pwrson you will enjoy the upgrade. Clear screen, fantastic camera quality, and night is pretty good as well. In my opinion a little pricey."
"Screen is a little splotchy, but it's an okay product."
"I use this camera to monitor a room in my apartment. Once set up, the camera has performed as expected. The video quality allows me to check in on my apartment when I want to, and the alerts have been useful in letting me know when movement is detected, with the ability to set sensitivity levels, which is nice. When perched up high, the two-way audio is not as useful as it could be, but that goes back to how I have decided to use the camera, and your mileage will vary depending on how you set yours up.

"This is a great product! It kills background noise greatly so I can focus on work, music and games. A must have !"
didnt type and would randomly have glitches
"This phone is completely faulty and unreliable. The alarm clock doesn't work and the phone constantly lags. Whenever I answer the phone, it takes a few seconds to register and pick up my voice. I am very displeased."
"Absolutely love the camera. We've owned other companies cameras in the past, and this one is by the top of the line. Picture quality is amazing, and the ability to speak/listen is great! Would recommend this product to others in a heartbeat."
"The nest camera was wonderfully packaged, was clear in it's instructions of how to set up with wi-fi, and was exceptionally easy to install. We are considering purchasing one more for the back yard."
"These headphones have amazing sound quality, connectivity features, and no nonsense operability. The issue I encountered was the build quality is flimsy on the hinges. I've used these at an average of 2 to 3 times a week for 2 to 3 hours taking transit for 5 months. I was just using the headphones this afternoon lying on my bed (45 degree recline if that even matters) and then I felt something graze the back of my ear like something fell off and then I saw chips of plastic. I quickly inspected my headphones and saw that it came from the hinge plate that's in between the foam headband and the ear cup. I inspected the other side and saw that the other was also coming undone and it had a crack already. It seems like there's stress forming on these spots because the cracks were uniform. Hopefully the entirety of the hinge plates don't fall off."
Does the job. Talking through the intercom is a tad bit slow. But it definitely gets the job done
Doesn't work with Apple products. Waste of money.
Stylish and sleek. Looks great on the wall and sounds good as well. I am very happy with my purchase.
"The Collider HR watch is very nice itself, but the software is absolutely terrible. A few issues: - Color: Watch is much darker than the photos. Its more black than light brown. Still looks nice, but NOT the color you see in the photos. - App Notification: the app only supports notifications for 13 apps. I have several others there are required - Wyze Cam, Hangouts Chat (separate app from Hangouts) Skype, etc. I don't understand this limited availability. I saw in an announcement that they are releasing support for more apps (including Google Inbox [which doesn't exist anymore]). However they will never keep up with the thounds of new apps being introduced everyday that people use. - While the watch has several useful functions (Stopwatch, View Past Notifications, Wellness Dashboard, Workout Mode, Music Control, Timer, Weather), the only way to access them on the watch is to link them to one of the 3 buttons. Lets say you don't have the Stopwatch linked to one of the 3 buttons - want to access it? You can't. You can set up multiple 'profiles' with different functions linked, but you have to go into your phone, into the Fossil App, and change it. - Do Not Disturb schedule doesn't link with phone. The app will notify me even if the phone is in DND mode (for example overnight). The watch either needs to copy the DND from the phone, or be able to set a schedule for DND. - Turn of HR sensor. I don't care about continuous HR monitoring. I'd like the ability to turn off the HR monitoring, which you can't do. - Phantom notifications. I get all kinds of notifications for apps that only come through on the watch and not the phone. For example, The watch buzzes with notification when it's clearing, and 'no new message' with Snapchat. - Alarms & timers syncing from the phone - if you set a timer on your phone, the watch does not notify you if it goes off. You have to go into the Fossil App and set a timer in there to get your watch to buzz. - Random disconnect"
A perfect entry level drone that works very well. Calibration is key for this worthy uav. Have exceeded 200+ flights that average 12-13 minutes per flight. An epic bargin even at $99. ...
I bought several as gifts. I like it a lot. I own two. Great sound. Party starter! Would make a great wedding gift or birthday or graduation. You'll end up using it more than you think. Four stars because wheels should be 360.
I started coloring with these pencils as soon as they arrived. I've used others where as soon as you pressed just a little hard they would break immediately but these didn't. The lead seems to be nice and sturdy and it draws smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Got for gaming and its been good
Phone working great and little of no signs of scratches and no dents... another seller I'll buy from again. It met all my expectations happy that I did.
This little guy has excellent sound. It also holds a long charge! I used it recently at an outdoors event and the volume was perfect. It's compact size is perfect and fits in my purse. I am able to use my phone charger to charge the speaker as well which is a plus. The color is sophisticated. A great buy all around!
This was a gift for my daughter who wanted a water-proof blue tooth speaker. Though it has nice features and the sound was better than I thought it would be - the speaker was returned. The speaker worked for approximately 1 week for which it then failed. It failed to pair to any device. It failed to power off. We returned it and will be looking for a different speaker.
Bought online as a special gift for my daughter. She said it was perfect size for her bedroom
I love the phone. My problem is the random restarts that had happened since getting the phone. Also some programs are running slower than the s5 that I use to have. Also settings are set up differently so it is taking time to get use to it. I like the features and I'm loving the external storage being brought back. I love the speaker being on the bottom instead of on the back. Not thrilled that the headphone jack is on the bottom. Love love love love the camera.
right side is the only side that works left side and control button doesn't work on both sets I ordered
"I purchased this camera with the understanding I could connect it to my LaView NVR. This wireless camera connects to the network only through an app created specifically for it. If the app does not work on your phone, there is no one way to connect it to the network. It took several days waiting for the Tech support to get back to me regarding the problems I was having with connecting the camera through the app. The only help provided was to send me instructions on how to connect through the app. I attempted to connect through this app six to nine times with no resolution. Each wireless camera seem to have a different app to specifically connect."
